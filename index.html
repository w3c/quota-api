      This document is a proposal that is being made available for public

      and standardization.
    </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Today we have a variety of storage APIs
      that can store inherently complex or large data
      in order to satisfy offline data requirements of Web applications.
      Examples of these APIs include:
      Application Cache [[OFFLINE-WEBAPPS]],
      FileSystem API [[FILE-SYSTEM]][[NEW-FILE-SYSTEM]],
      Indexed Database [[INDEXEDDB]] and
      Web SQL Database [[WEB-SQL]].
      </p>
      <p>
      These APIs may require larger local space than the conventional
      cookie storage or Web Storage [[WEBSTORAGE]], but they do not provide
      a means by which a Web application can query and manage how much
      data is currently stored and how much more can be stored.
      </p>
      <p>
      This specification defines an API to query and manage usage and
      availability of a user's local storage.  The storage space granted
      by the API is intended to be shared by different storage APIs,
      therefore a user and UA only need to manage a single upper limit
      for all storage per logical application unit, e.g. per origin or
      per browser (which is implementation specific).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='conformance'>
    <p>
     User agents that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
     specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
     ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]] as this
     specification uses that specification and terminology.

      <h2>Storage Types</h2>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Temporary vs Persistent</h3>
      <p>
        A Web application can request <a>temporary</a> or
        <a>persistent</a> local storage space depending
        on its purpose.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <dfn id="temporary">Temporary</dfn> storage is a transient
        storage that is more easily accessible by any Web applications
        without upfront quota requests or user prompting,
        but the data stored in the storage
        may get deleted at any time at the UA's discretion.
        This storage can be viewed as analogous to the '/tmp' directory of
        a traditional filesystem.
        <li>
        <dfn id="persistent">Persistent</dfn> storage needs an upfront
        quota request which possibly triggers user prompting, but should
        never get deleted by the UA without the userâ€™s explicit
        instruction.
      </ul>

        <p>
        <a>Temporary</a> storage is especially useful
        if an application wants to cache data locally to improve
        its performance, but can fall back to fetching or recreating
        the same data in case of data loss from temporary storage.
        </p>

        <p>
        Conversely, <a>persistent</a> storage is useful
        if an application wants to store critical offline data that
        is necessary for its function, or wants to manage the amount
        or lifecycle of local data on its own, rather than relying on
        the UA's default eviction policy for <a>temporary</a> storage.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h4>Examples</h4>
        <p>
        Suppose there is a photo editing application.
        This application
        manages user photo data using Indexed Database [[INDEXEDDB]],
        stores photo images using the Filesystem API [[FILE-SYSTEM]]
        [[NEW-FILE-SYSTEM]] and
        optionally utilizes Application Cache [[OFFLINE-WEBAPPS]]
        to make it work offline.
        </p>
        <p>
        The application needs to query how much data it can store in the
        <a>temporary</a> storage
        to determine its initial cache size.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          // Query current usage and availability in Temporary storage:
          navigator.storageQuota.queryInfo("temporary").then(
            function(storageInfo) {
              // Continue to initialize local cache using the obtained
              // usage and remaining space (quota - usage) information.
              initializeCache(storageInfo.usage,
                              storageInfo.quota - storageInfo.usage);
            });
          </pre>

          <p>
          Similarly, the application needs to request
          additional persistent storage to support offline mode
          when it is enabled by the user.
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
          // A function which is to be called when 'offline-mode' is enabled
          // by the user.
          function onOfflineModeEnabled(amountOfSpaceNeeded) {
            // First check how much we can use in the Persistent storage.
            navigator.storageQuota.queryInfo("persistent").then(
              function (storageInfo) {
                var availableSpace = storageInfo.quota - storageInfo.usage;
                if (availableSpace >= amountOfSpaceNeeded) {
                  // We're fine; just continue with the returned storage info.
                  return storageInfo;
                }
                return navigator.storageQuota.requestPersistentQuota(
                    amountOfSpaceNeeded + storageInfo.usage);
              }
            ).then(
              function (storageInfo) {
                // Prepare for offline mode using the current available
                // storage space.
                prepareForOfflineMode(storageInfo.quota - storageInfo.usage);
              }, function (error) {
                // Handle error.
              }
            );

          the application for a given storage type.
          This includes the storage area that is already used by the
          application, so <code>storageInfo.usage</code> needs to be
          subtracted from <code>storageInfo.quota</code> to get the

        <p>
        The <a><code>StorageQuota</code></a> interface provides means to query
        and request storage usage and quota information.
        The API provided by the interface is asynchronous since
        querying or allocating space in a user's local storage may require
        blocking I/O operations, e.g. examining the local disk status or
        making changes in a local database.

           This method queries the storage info of the given storage
           <code>type</code>.
           This returns <code>StorageInfo</code> that has the current data
           usage and available quota information for the application.
           When <code>queryInfo</code> method is called, the UA must
           run the following steps:
           <ol>
             <li>Let <var>storageType</var> be the first argument.

               <li>If the <var>storageType</var> is not supported by the user
              agent (i.e. not in the <code>supportedTypes</code> array),
              reject <var>p</var> with a "NotSupportedError" exception
              and abort these steps.

           It is not guaranteed that the requested amount of space
           is granted just by calling this API, and the UA
           may return a new <code><a>StorageInfo</a></code> object
           (without rejecting the request) with a smaller quota value
           than requested.
           Calling this API may trigger user prompting to request
           explicit user permission to proceed.
           </p>
           When <code class="idlType">requestPersistentQuota</code> method is
           called, the UA must run the following steps:

        <a><code>StorageWatcher</code></a> interface is to watch real time

        than 50ms.
        </p>

        <p>
        Regardless of the <code>rate</code> value,

      <h2>Quota handling in storage APIs</h2>
      Storage APIs except for Web Storage, i.e.
      Application Cache,
      File System API,
      Indexed Database and Web SQL Database,
      should respect the quota management API and must have the following properties:
      <ul>
        <li> Any write requests which will exceed the granted quota limit should
        fail with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-domexception-quota_exceeded_err">QuotaExceededError</a>
        <code>DOMError</code> or <code>DOMException</code>
        (including when the granted quota is zero, i.e. the UA refuses
        to grant any quota or the storage is disabled for the site).
        As an exception, if the write is being made in the background where
        it cannot throw
        exception or return an error, the API may fail silently.  For example, Application Cache may silently discard or fail to cache data when it is hitting quota limit.
        <li> For FileSystem API [[FILE-SYSTEM]][[NEW-FILE-SYSTEM]] the UA must store data for <b>temporary filesystem</b> in <a>temporary</a> storage, and data for <b>persistent filesystem</b> in <a>persistent</a> storage.
        <li> For Application Cache [[OFFLINE-WEBAPPS]] the UA must store its cache data
          in <a>temporary</a> storage.
        <li> Other storage APIs may store data in either <a
          href="#temporary">temporary</a> or <a
          href="#persistent">persistent</a> storage.  When an API stores data in
        <a>persistent</a> storage by default, storing data or
        opening the storage (e.g. opening a database) may trigger user prompting by the UA to request for user permission.
      </ul>

        <div class='note'>
          <p>
          Indexed Database [[INDEXEDDB]] is expected to have <a>temporary</a>
          and <a>persistent</a> storage types in its next version, and
          when that happens the UA should store data for temporary database
          in <a>temporary</a> storage and for persistent database
          in <a>persistent</a> storage, respectively.
